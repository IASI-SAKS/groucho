# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application:
``mvn spring-boot:run``

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to:
 * ``http://localhost:8080/groucho-state-observer/``

Change default deployment configurations of Spring-boot (e.g. the port value) in the files:
 * [application.properties](https://github.com/IASI-SAKS/groucho/tree/master/groucho-lsh-rest/src/main/resources/application.properties)
 * [applicationContext.xml](https://github.com/IASI-SAKS/groucho/tree/master/groucho-lsh-rest/src/main/resources/applicationContext.xml)
