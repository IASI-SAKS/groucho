/*
 * This class is a re-implementation of the original Unit Test:
 * ch.usi.precrime.lrucache.LRUCacheTest
 * developed at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI) 
 * independently from the GROUCHO project, and by only consulting
 * the documentation available about LRUCache in OSCache project. 
 * 
 * This new implementation has only 2 minor purposes:
 * 1. separate the configuration part of the tests from their actual execution.
 *    this way it is easier to reuse them during invivo testing sessions.
 * 2. the tests assume the memory may not be empty, thus the for statements
 *    that locally populate the memory starts from the item at position `memory.getSize()`    
 * For all the rest the test is completely equivalent
 * to the one originally conceived by the tester at USI.
